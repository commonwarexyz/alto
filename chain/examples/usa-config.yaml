# Example configuration for the alto follower node (USA cluster)
#
# This configuration connects to the USA alto exoware relay
# and stores finalized blocks locally.
#
# NOTE: You need to replace the identity with the correct one for the USA cluster

# URL of the exoware relay or indexer endpoint
source: "https://usa.alto.exoware.xyz"

# Hex-encoded BLS12-381 public key of the network identity
# This is the threshold public key used to verify finalization signatures
# TODO: Replace with actual USA cluster identity
identity: "REPLACE_WITH_USA_CLUSTER_IDENTITY"

# Directory for storing finalized blocks and state
directory: "/tmp/alto-follower-usa"

# Number of worker threads
worker_threads: 4

# Log level (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
log_level: "info"

# Port for Prometheus metrics endpoint
metrics_port: 9092

# Auto-checkpoint from the latest finalized block on first run
# Set to false to start from genesis (requires backfilling all historical blocks)
auto_checkpoint: true
