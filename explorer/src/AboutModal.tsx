                            <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/alto">alto</a> is a minimal (and wicked fast) blockchain built with the <a href="https://github.com/commonwarexyz/monorepo">Commonware Library</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By minimal, we mean minimal. alto's state transition function consists of just <strong>3 rules</strong>. Each block must:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase the height by 1</li>
                            <li>Reference the digest of its parent</li>

                            This explorer displays the progression of <i>threshold-simplex</i> over time, broken into <strong>views</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Validators enter a new view whenever they observe either <i>2f+1</i> votes for a block proposal or <i>2f+1</i> nullifies
                            (to skip this view) AND some seed (a VRF used to select the next leader). Validators finalize a view whenever they
                            observe <i>2f+1</i> finalizes for a block proposal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We color the phases of a view as follows:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="status-list">
                            <li>
                                <div className="status-indicator-wrapper">
                                    <div className="about-status-indicator" style={{ backgroundColor: "#0000eeff" }}></div>
                                    <strong>Seed</strong>
                                </div>
                                Some leader has been elected to propose a block. The dot on the map (of the same color) is the region where the leader is located.
                                A new leader is elected for each view.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <div className="status-indicator-wrapper">
                                    <div className="about-status-indicator" style={{ backgroundColor: "#000" }}></div>
                                    <strong>Locked</strong>
                                </div>
                                Some block <i>b</i> has received <i>2f+1</i> votes in a given view <i>v</i>. This means there can never be another locked block
                                in view <i>v</i> (and block <i>b</i> must be used in the canonical chain if <i>2f+1</i> participants did not move to nullify).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <div className="status-indicator-wrapper">
                                    <div className="about-status-indicator" style={{ backgroundColor: "#274e13ff" }}></div>
                                    <strong>Finalized</strong>
                                </div>
                                The block <i>b</i> in view <i>v</i> has received <i>2f+1</i> finalizes. The block is now immutable.
                            </li>

                        <h3>Why is it so fast?</h3>
                        <p>
                            <i>threshold-simplex</i>, like <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/463">Simplex Consensus</a>, employs <strong>all-to-all broadcast</strong> and <strong>progress-driven view transitions</strong> to
                            achieve optimal latency in both the optimistic and pessimistic case (under the partial synchrony model).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using authenticated connections (provided by <a href="https://docs.rs/commonware-p2p/latest/commonware_p2p/authenticated/index.html">p2p::authenticated</a>), each validator
                            sends consensus messages directly to every other validator (no leader relay or multi-hop gossip). As soon as any validator observes <i>2f+1</i> votes for a block proposal, they broadcast
                            a threshold signature (again directly) to all other validators and enter the next view immediately (without waiting for finalization or any timeout). If a validator sees a threshold signature
                            for a view <i>v</i>, they enter view <i>v+1</i> immediately (ensuring validators stay synchronized without using a clock).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            English? <i>threshold-simplex</i> moves at <strong>network speed</strong> (and it turns out that's pretty fast in 2025).

                        <h3>Where is the data coming from?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We deployed alto to a cluster of <strong>50 validators</strong> running c7g.xlarge (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) nodes on AWS in <strong>10 regions</strong> (us-west-1, us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1, eu-north-1, ap-south-1, sa-east-1, eu-central-1, ap-northeast-2, ap-southeast-2).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you visit this page, however, you don't connect to any of those nodes. You connect to custom-built infrastructure (<a href="https://exoware.xyz">exoware::relay</a>) that streams consensus
                            artifacts to your browser in real time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because each consensus artifact is accompanied by a threshold signature, your browser can (and does) verify each inbound message using <a href="https://docs.rs/commonware-cryptography/latest/commonware_cryptography/bls12381/index.html">cryptography::bls12381</a> compiled to WASM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's right, your browser is verifying every message it receives was emitted from consensus in real time. Don't trust an API, trust the open source verifier code running on your computer.
                        </p>
