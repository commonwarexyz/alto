# Hex-encoded BLS12-381 public key of the network identity
# This is the threshold public key used to verify finalization signatures

# Auto-checkpoint from the latest finalized block on first run.
# When true (default), the follower will fetch the latest finalized block
# from the indexer and use that as the starting point, avoiding the need
